        This site is run by Swarnim Mandal, an individual based in London, United Kingdom. I am the
        controller of the personal data described here. You can reach me at{" "}
        <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a>.

        <strong>Contact and enquiry forms.</strong> When you send a message, I receive your name,
        email address and what you write. The AI Receptionist enquiry form also asks for your
        business name, industry, an estimate of missed calls and, optionally, a phone number.

        <strong>Analytics.</strong> I use Vercel Web Analytics and Speed Insights to count page views
        and measure performance. They do not use cookies and do not identify individual visitors;
        they record aggregate data such as the page visited, referrer, country, browser and device
        type.
      </>,
      <>
        <strong>Server logs.</strong> My hosting provider keeps short-lived technical logs (for
        example IP address and request time) to operate and secure the site.

  {
    heading: "Why, and on what basis",
    body: [
      <>
        I use form submissions only to reply to you and, if we work together, to deliver what we
        agreed. The lawful basis is my legitimate interest in responding to enquiries, or taking
        steps at your request before entering into a contract.
      </>,
      <>
        Analytics and logs are used to understand which pages are useful and to keep the site
        running securely — also a legitimate interest. I do not sell your data or use it for
        advertising.

    heading: "Who processes it",

      <>
        <strong>Vercel</strong> hosts the site and provides analytics. <strong>Resend</strong>{" "}
        delivers form submissions to my inbox, which is hosted by <strong>Google</strong>. These
        providers may process data outside the UK under appropriate safeguards such as the UK
        International Data Transfer Addendum.

  {
    heading: "How long I keep it",
    body: [
      <>
        Enquiries are kept for up to two years after our last contact, unless we go on to work
        together, in which case they are kept for as long as needed for that work and any legal
        obligations. You can ask me to delete them sooner.

    heading: "AI Receptionist callers",
    body: [
      <>
        When I run the AI Receptionist for a business, the details its callers give are processed on
        behalf of that business, which is the controller of that data. If you called a business
        using it, please contact that business about your data; I will help them respond.
      </>,

  },
  {
    heading: "Your rights",
    body: [
      <>
        Under UK data protection law you can ask to access, correct or delete your personal data, to
        restrict or object to how I use it, and to receive a copy of it. Email{" "}
        <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a> and I will respond within one month.

        If you are unhappy with how I have handled your data, you can complain to the Information
        Commissioner&apos;s Office at <a href="https://ico.org.uk">ico.org.uk</a>.
